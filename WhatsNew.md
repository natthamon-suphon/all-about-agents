# What's New

All notable changes to all-about-agents. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The version is the
`version` field of `package.json`; both rendered plugin manifests read it from there.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `npm run setup` (`scripts/setup.mjs`): one guarded pipeline for installing this
  repository into the local products. `--mode fresh` clears every previous render
  from the package root first; `--mode update` keeps the root and syncs it with the
  current checkout. Both then remove the installed plugin, render, commit the Codex
  plugin source when it changed, register each surface, and list what each product
  reports. Planning is the default and `--apply` is required to mutate. The run
  refuses a home directory, a live product root, this repository, or any directory
  without a rendered package marker, and it never deletes inside the product roots.
  See `docs/maintenance/sync-and-update.md`.

### Fixed

- `npm run test:model` scored the announcement by a literal `Using skill **<skill>`
  string, with a fallback that accepted the skill name plus the word "skill"
  anywhere in the answer. Nothing rendered into the package carries that literal
  string, so compliant announcements were recorded as `FAIL`, and a non-trigger
  answer that named the skill to explain why it stayed unused was recorded as an
  announcement. A case now counts as announced when one line carries the canonical
  skill name together with its emoji from `core/presentation/emoji-registry.json`,
  which is what `core/instructions/global-operating-rules.md` asks for.
- A case that outruns its budget is `NOT_RUN_UNAVAILABLE`, not `FAIL`: a slow
  session is an environment fact, not a routing verdict. The budget moved from a
  fixed 180000 ms to 300000 ms and reads `AAA_CASE_TIMEOUT_MS` when it is set.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- `install` no longer treats a package root as unmanaged when its managed state
  exists but cannot be read (for example a 1.x root that names a removed surface).
  `--dry-run` reports `invalid-previous-state`; `--apply` refuses before any
  mutation with `managed state merge rejected before mutation`. Before, such a root
  was rendered over silently and its stale files were never pruned. Remedy: empty the
  root and render again (see `docs/maintenance/sync-and-update.md`).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-19

Phases 3 and 4 of the simplification spec. Install this version, not 2.0.0: the
merged `main` already contains both phases.

Phase 3: skill content pulled from superpowers v6.3.0.

### Changed

- `using-all-about-agents` (the bootstrap skill) now carries the 1% rule, the
  skill-priority order, a red-flags table, and a SUBAGENT-STOP block, while keeping
  the portable-routing and unavailable-capability rules. 488 words.
- `brainstorming` classifies every request as spike, bounded, or architectural before
  the first question; the artifact scales down, the approval gate never does. Two
  routing cases added.
- `subagent-driven-development` adds the pre-dispatch conflict scan with ledger
  rulings, dispatch hygiene, same-kind batching, and ledger recovery after compaction.
- `writing-skills` adds the form-to-failure table and word budgets.
- `improve-codebase-architecture` may be invoked by the model once the human asks for
  or agrees to a survey; `systematic-debugging` recommends it instead of calling it
  user-only.
- Generic operating rules (untrusted data, preserve unrelated work, no invented paths,
  record not-run) were removed from 19 skills where they only restated the global
  rules; skill-specific forms stay.

Phase 4: truthful test vocabulary and a manual model-run suite.

### Changed

- The regex skill tests moved from `tests/behavioral/` to `tests/lint/`; the focused
  gate check is `skill-lint` and the validator error is `missing-lint-test`. Docs no
  longer call a regex check behavioral.

### Added

- `npm run test:model` runs the routing cases of five critical skills through real
  headless `claude -p` sessions and records PASS, FAIL, or NOT_RUN_UNAVAILABLE per case
  under `.aaa/eval-runs/`. It refuses to spawn sessions when the installed plugin
  version differs from `package.json` or the rendered global CLAUDE.md is missing.
  `quality:full` reports the age of the newest result as optional evidence only.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-19

Phases 1 and 2 of `docs/plans/2026-09-18-simplify-to-claude-codex.md`.

### Removed

- Antigravity 2.0 Desktop and `agy` surfaces: adapters, manifests, snapshots,
  capability records, compatibility pages, evaluation record, and tests.
- The eight `aaa:*` commands and six workflow state machines, their schemas, the role
  router, and the action-mapping validation in the adapter contract.
- `quarantine/legacy` (recoverable from Git history at `5d185ce` and earlier).
- Superpowers authoring files that were shipped as `systematic-debugging` assets, and
  the Antigravity, Gemini, and Pi tool references of the bootstrap skill.
- The rendered "Using skill / Invoking agent" preamble on every skill and role. The
  announce-and-checklist rule is stated once in the global operating rules.
- The "Announce at start" sentences inside five skills, for the same reason.

### Changed

- The bootstrap hook injects the routing skill on `startup`, `clear`, and `compact`
  SessionStart sources, so the routing contract survives `/clear` and compaction.
- The plugin version comes from `package.json`; `2.0.0` replaces the literal `1.0.0`
  that never changed. Reinstall the Claude plugin after a version change (see
  `docs/maintenance/sync-and-update.md`).
- `quality:full` keeps the last 8,000 characters of a failing check, so the failing
  test names at the end of `node --test` output survive.

### Security

- `install --apply` requires an explicit `--destination-root` and fails closed with
  `destination-root-required`; automatic root discovery serves only `--dry-run`,
  `doctor`, and `diff`. Added after an integration test wrote a render into the live
  `~/.claude` and `~/.codex` roots (incident D9 in the spec).

### Added

- `tests/static/surface-scope.test.mjs` guards invariant I4: no tracked file names a
  removed surface, command, workflow, or quarantine path.
