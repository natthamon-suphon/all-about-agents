# What's New

All notable changes to all-about-agents. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The version is the
`version` field of `package.json`; both rendered plugin manifests read it from there.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-19

Phases 1 and 2 of `docs/plans/2026-09-18-simplify-to-claude-codex.md`.

### Removed

- Antigravity 2.0 Desktop and `agy` surfaces: adapters, manifests, snapshots,
  capability records, compatibility pages, evaluation record, and tests.
- The eight `aaa:*` commands and six workflow state machines, their schemas, the role
  router, and the action-mapping validation in the adapter contract.
- `quarantine/legacy` (recoverable from Git history at `5d185ce` and earlier).
- Superpowers authoring files that were shipped as `systematic-debugging` assets, and
  the Antigravity, Gemini, and Pi tool references of the bootstrap skill.
- The rendered "Using skill / Invoking agent" preamble on every skill and role. The
  announce-and-checklist rule is stated once in the global operating rules.
- The "Announce at start" sentences inside five skills, for the same reason.

### Changed

- The bootstrap hook injects the routing skill on `startup`, `clear`, and `compact`
  SessionStart sources, so the routing contract survives `/clear` and compaction.
- The plugin version comes from `package.json`; `2.0.0` replaces the literal `1.0.0`
  that never changed. Reinstall the Claude plugin after a version change (see
  `docs/maintenance/sync-and-update.md`).
- `quality:full` keeps the last 8,000 characters of a failing check, so the failing
  test names at the end of `node --test` output survive.

### Security

- `install --apply` requires an explicit `--destination-root` and fails closed with
  `destination-root-required`; automatic root discovery serves only `--dry-run`,
  `doctor`, and `diff`. Added after an integration test wrote a render into the live
  `~/.claude` and `~/.codex` roots (incident D9 in the spec).

### Added

- `tests/static/surface-scope.test.mjs` guards invariant I4: no tracked file names a
  removed surface, command, workflow, or quarantine path.
